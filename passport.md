# Laravel Passport

See Laravel Passport [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport).

Use it if your application absolutely needs to support OAuth2, otherwise try more simple Laravel Sanctum.

## Installation

```bash
composer require laravel/passport
php artisan migrate
php artisan passport:install
```
